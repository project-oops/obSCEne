//! One logo, in every place it can appear. Windows is the only one of the three targets where an
//! executable can carry one: a Linux ELF and a macOS command-line binary have nowhere to put it -
//! theirs live in packaging metadata, a `.desktop` entry or an `.app` bundle, and a bare CLI has
//! neither. So there is nothing to do off Windows, and the dependency is gated in `Cargo.toml`
//! rather than here, so it is not fetched or built on those platforms at all.
//!
//! `assets/logo.ico` holds six sizes (16 through 256). Windows picks the one it wants rather than
//! rescaling a single large image, which matters for pixel art: the mark is a blocky drawing, and
//! a filtered downscale of the 256 turns it to mush at 16.
